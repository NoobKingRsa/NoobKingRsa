# 👋 Hey there! I'm NoobKingRsa 👑

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub! I'm on a mission to prove that you can build **a calculator in almost every programming language**—because why not?! 🤓 Here's a bit about me:

---

## 🌟 About Me
- **Title**: Self-proclaimed King of Noobs! 👑 (Every expert was once a noob, right?)
- **Philosophy**: If it doesn’t challenge you, it won’t change you. 💡
- **Superpower**: Breaking things just to figure out how to fix them. 🚀
- **Hobbies**: Coding calculators, collecting memes, and exploring the endless void of Stack Overflow.

## 🧮 The Great Calculator Challenge! 🤯

I’ve set myself a quirky yet awesome goal: **Build a calculator in as many programming languages as possible!** Why? Because calculators are like the “Hello, World!” of problem-solving—simple, fun, and oddly satisfying. 😎  

Here are my targets (so far):  

| Language        | Plan                           | Status       |
|-----------------|--------------------------------|--------------|
| **Python**      | Command-line & tkinter GUI    | 🚧 In Progress |
| **JavaScript**  | Web-based (HTML/CSS/JS)       | 🛠️ Coming Soon |
| **C**           | Console-based calculator      | ✅ Version 1 Done! |
| **C++**         | Console + GUI (Qt)            | 🛠️ Coming Soon |
| **Java**        | Swing GUI calculator          | 🛠️ Coming Soon |
| **Ruby**        | Sinatra web-based calculator  | 🛠️ Coming Soon |
| **Swift**       | iOS app with SwiftUI          | 🛠️ Coming Soon |
| **Kotlin**      | Android app                   | 🛠️ Coming Soon |
| **Go**          | Command-line rocket speed 🚀  | 🛠️ Coming Soon |
| **Rust**        | High-performance CLI calc     | 🛠️ Coming Soon |
| **Shell Script**| Basic bash magic 🐚           | 🛠️ Coming Soon |

...and the list keeps growing! If you have a favorite programming language, **challenge me** to make a calculator in it. I dare you! 😏

## 💻 What I Code (Besides Calculators)
- **Languages**: JavaScript, Python, C, C++, and a sprinkle of Rust and Go.
- **Frameworks**: React, Node.js, and whatever shiny new thing catches my eye. ✨
- **Favorite Tools**: GitHub Actions, Docker, and my trusty keyboard. ⌨️  

---

## 🌱 Currently Learning
- **TypeScript**: Because JavaScript deserves some structure.  
- **Docker**: Containers are cool. 🐳  
- **AI/ML**: Maybe one day I'll make an AI that can code calculators for me. 🤖

Thanks for scrolling this far! You’re awesome. 😄 Feel free to explore my repositories, star them (if you love them), or even better—collaborate with me!  

Let’s build something amazing (and maybe a calculator or two). 🚀
