# 👋 Yo! I'm NoobKingRsa 👑

Welcome to the part of GitHub where payloads get spicy 🌶️ and “ethical hacking” means pushing limits—legally, of course. 😎

- **Mission**: Build & share powerful payloads for Ducky, Flipper, and beyond 🛠️
- **Superpower**: Turning USBs into weapons (for good!) ⚔️
- **Hobbies**: Breaking things (legally), bypassing UAC like it’s a game, and building tools for the underground—*above ground.* 🚀


## 💣 Payload Arsenal: Demo to Pro

I’ve switched from calculators to **custom payloads, ethical hacker kits**, and 🔥 **script bundles** for:
- USB Rubber Ducky (inject.txt 💉)
